Discussion:
1. If I use the same data provider for end to end checkout and add to cart it forces me to define the extra 3 parameters that I use in the end to end test but do not require in addtoCart. Should we use a separate data provider or just define all the parameters and use only the ones required.
2. Used the testng base class but the tests only run individually not through the base class
